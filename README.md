# Swiss Housing Price Analysis and Prediction

In this project, we analyze housing prices across Switzerland using data scraped from `homegate24`. We explore the relationship between house prices and various features, visualize our findings through plots and maps, and build a machine learning model to predict house prices.

## Introduction
This project aims to provide insights into the housing market in Switzerland, understanding factors that influence prices and predict future housing prices.

## Background
Switzerland's diverse geography and regional variations make its housing market an interesting subject for analysis. Understanding the price dynamics can be beneficial for buyers, sellers, investors, and policymakers.

## Data Collection
The data for this project was scraped from `homegate24` using:
- BeautifulSoup
- Playwright
- Selenium

## Data Cleaning and Pre-processing
Our primary data wrangling tasks included:
- Handling missing values
- Converting data types where necessary
- Removing any outliers or anomalous entries

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The dataset was explored to:
- Understand the distribution of housing prices across different regions
- Identify correlations between housing price and other features
- Visualizations included various plots and geospatial maps to highlight regional price variations.

## Methodology
1. **Feature Analysis**: Studied how various features, such as location, property size, and amenities, influence housing prices.
2. **Machine Learning Model**: Built a model using ["Random Forest", "Linear Regression", etc.] to predict housing prices based on the identified significant features.

## Results
Our analysis revealed key trends, such as _. The machine learning model achieved an accuracy of _ in predicting house prices.

## Discussion
Our findings highlight the nuanced nature of the Swiss housing market. While some regions showed expected price trends, there were surprising findings in [Specific regions or due to certain features]. Potential limitations of our analysis include [Any limitations or biases in the data or approach].

## Conclusion
Through web scraping, visualization, and machine learning, we've derived valuable insights into the housing market in Switzerland. Our model provides a foundation for those looking to make data-driven decisions in this sector.

## Recommendations
1. Homebuyers and investors can leverage this analysis to find undervalued regions or properties.
2. Policymakers can use the insights for housing and urban development planning.
3. Future iterations can integrate more features or use advanced models for enhanced prediction accuracy.
